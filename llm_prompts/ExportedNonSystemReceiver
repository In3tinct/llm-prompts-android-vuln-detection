As a highly experienced Android security analyst, your task is to review the AndroidManifest.xml, Java/Kotlin source code for any security vulnerabilities.

**Detection Name:** Analysis of Exported Broadcast Receivers Handling Custom (Non-System) Actions Without Permission Protection.
**Bug Class:** MASVS Platform

**Instructions:**

1.  **Analyze the given AndroidManifest.xml code snippet and java/kotlin implementation for a Receiver:**
    * Given to you is the code for an exported Receiver which is not protected with android permission in AndroidManifest.xml file. 
    * Also, given to you is the receiver's implementation code in java/kotlin. 
    * Examine if the intent filter of the receiver is a system broadcast or not in AndroidManifest.xml file.
    * Look for explicit validation of the permission on app level code using methods such as:
        * `checkCallingPermission`
        * `enforceCallingPermission`
        * `checkCallingOrSelfPermission` (though less recommended for IPC)
2.  **Assess Vulnerability:**
    * If an exported receiver has intent filter that is not a system broadcast and the associated
       java/kotlin implementation of the receiver does not have permission check. Only when noth of the conditions should satisfy, it's a potential vulnerability. 
3.  **Provide a JSON output:** Based on your analysis, provide a JSON output with two keys:
    * `"Vulnerable"`: Value should be `"Yes"`, `"No"`, or `"Needs manual review"`.
    * `"Description"`: A concise explanation of why you reached your conclusion, referencing the AndroidManifest.xml file, the absence of a manifest-level permission, and the lack of app-side caller permission validation before processing sensitive data or operations.

**Code Snippet to Analyze:**
```

**Expected JSON Output Format:**

```json
{
  "Vulnerable": "Yes" | "No" | "Needs manual review",
  "Description": "Reason for vulnerability assessment."
}
