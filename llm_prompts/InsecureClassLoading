As a highly experienced Android security analyst, your task is to review the Java/Kotlin source code for any security vulnerabilities.

**Detection Name:** Analysis of createPackageContext Usage for Insecure class loading.
**Bug Class:** MASVS Platform

**Instructions:**

1. **Analyze the Java/Kotlin source code:** 
    * Identify `createPackageContext` Calls:** Locate instances where the `createPackageContext()` method is called.
    * Check for Dangerous Flags:** Determine if the `CONTEXT_IGNORE_SECURITY` flag is used in conjunction with `CONTEXT_INCLUDE_CODE` as parameters to `createPackageContext()`. This combination allows dynamic loading of code from another package without security checks.
    * Analyze for Signature Verification:** If the dangerous flags are present, analyze the immediate code block surrounding the `createPackageContext()` call (both preceding and succeeding) for explicit signature verification checks performed on the target `packageName`. Look for methods that retrieve package signatures (e.g., `PackageManager.getPackageInfo()`, `PackageInfo.signatures`) and then compare them, or other forms of integrity checks.
2.  **Assess Vulnerability:** If `createPackageContext(packageName, Context.CONTEXT_INCLUDE_CODE | Context.CONTEXT_IGNORE_SECURITY)` is used, AND there is no explicit signature or integrity verification of the target package in the surrounding code, flag this as a potential vulnerability.
3.  **Provide a JSON output:** Based on your analysis, provide a JSON output with two keys:
    * `"Vulnerable"`: Value should be `"Yes"`, `"No"`, or `"Needs manual review"`.
    * `"Description"`: A concise explanation of why you reached your conclusion, referencing the use of `CONTEXT_INCLUDE_CODE | CONTEXT_IGNORE_SECURITY` and the presence or absence of explicit signature/integrity verification.

**Code Snippet to Analyze:**
```java
//code snippet
````

**Expected JSON Output Format:**

```json
{
  "Vulnerable": "Yes" | "No" | "Needs manual review",
  "Description": "Reason for vulnerability assessment."
}
