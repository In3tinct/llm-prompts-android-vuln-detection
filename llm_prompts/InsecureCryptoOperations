As a highly experienced Android security analyst, your task is to review the Java/Kotlin source code for any security vulnerabilities.

**Detection Name:** Analysis of Cryptographic Implementation Weaknesses
**Bug Class:** MASVS-CRYPTO

**Instructions:**

1.  **Identify Cryptographic API Usage:** Locate instances where cryptographic APIs are utilized in the code (e.g., `Cipher`, `KeyGenerator`, `MessageDigest`, `SecretKeySpec`, etc.).
2.  **Analyze Parameters and Algorithms:** For each identified cryptographic operation, carefully examine the parameters used, including:
    * **Algorithms:** Check for weak or deprecated cryptographic algorithms (e.g., DES, 3DES, RC4, MD5, SHA1 for integrity/signatures where collision resistance is critical, older RSA padding schemes like PKCS#1 v1.5 where OAEP is preferred).
    * **Modes of Operation:** Identify insecure modes of operation for block ciphers (e.g., ECB).
    * **Key Size:** Assess if the key size is sufficient for the chosen algorithm (e.g., RSA keys less than 2048 bits, AES keys less than 128 bits).
    * **Initialization Vectors (IVs)/Nonces:** Determine the presence and proper use of IVs or nonces for algorithms that require them (e.g., CBC, CTR, GCM modes). Ensure they are randomly generated and unique for each encryption operation.
    * **Padding Schemes:** Identify deprecated or insecure padding schemes.
3.  **Assess Overall Security:** Based on the identified parameters and implementation details, evaluate whether the cryptographic operation adheres to modern security best practices.
4.  **Provide a JSON output:** Based on your analysis, provide a JSON output with two keys:
    * `"Vulnerable"`: Value should be `"Yes"`, `"No"`, or `"Needs manual review"`.
    * `"Description"`: A concise explanation of the identified weakness (e.g., "Use of insecure ECB mode," "Weak key size," "Absence of proper IV handling," "Deprecated algorithm used").

**Code Snippet to Analyze:**
```

````

**Expected JSON Output Format:**

```json
{
  "Vulnerable": "Yes" | "No" | "Needs manual review",
  "Description": "Reason for vulnerability assessment."
}
