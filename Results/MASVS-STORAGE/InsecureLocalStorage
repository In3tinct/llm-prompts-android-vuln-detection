{
  "Vulnerable": "Yes",
  "Description": "The code stores a user's PIN in 'SharedPreferences' using 'editor.putString(\"userPin_code\", userPin)' without any encryption. SharedPreferences are stored in a plain text XML file within the app's private data directory. While 'MODE_PRIVATE' restricts direct access from other unprivileged apps, a rooted device or an attacker with physical access could easily read this sensitive information, along with vulnerability like arbitrary file read etc. This constitutes insecure sensitive data storage, violating MASVS-STORAGE principles."
