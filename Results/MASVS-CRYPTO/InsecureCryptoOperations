  "Vulnerable": "Yes",
  "Description": "The code uses AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding. ECB (Electronic Codebook) is an insecure mode of operation for block ciphers because it encrypts identical blocks of plaintext into identical blocks of ciphertext, revealing patterns in the original data. It also lacks authentication, meaning ciphertext can be tampered with undetected. While PKCS5Padding itself is not inherently insecure when used with appropriate modes, its use here with ECB does not mitigate the ECB weakness. The key size of 128 bits for AES is generally acceptable, but the fundamental flaw lies in the choice of ECB mode. No Initialization Vector (IV) or nonce is used, which is appropriate for ECB (as it doesn't use one), but the lack of an IV is precisely why ECB is insecure."
