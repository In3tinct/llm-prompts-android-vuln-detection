{
  "Vulnerable": "No",
  "Description": "The ContentProvider 'InsecureShopProvider' is exported and does not have write permissions declared in AndroidManifest.xml (as assumed by the problem description). However, the `insert()`, `delete()`, and `update()` methods are all empty and return null or 0, indicating that they do not contain any actual data modification logic. Therefore, even without explicit write permission checks, there is no vulnerability related to insecure write operations."
