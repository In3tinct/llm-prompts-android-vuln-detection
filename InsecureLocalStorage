As a highly experienced Android security analyst, your task is to review the Java/Kotlin source code for any security vulnerabilities.

**Detection Name:** Analysis of Insecure Sensitive Data Storage
**Bug Class:** MASVS-STORAGE

**Instructions:**

1.  **Analyze the code context:** Identify all instances where local data storage mechanisms (SharedPreferences, file systems, local databases) are utilized.
2.  **Identify potentially sensitive variables/keys:** Look for variable names or keys associated with stored data functions that strongly suggest sensitive information. Examples include, but are not limited to:
    * `apiKey`
    * `creditCardNumber`
    * `userPassword`
    * `pin`
    * `token`
    * `sessionId`
    * `privateKey`
    * `ssn`
    * `address`
    * `email`
    * `phone`
    * `dob`
3.  **Check for encryption/secure storage:** Determine if the corresponding code context includes explicit calls to encryption routines (e.g., `Cipher`, `KeyStore`, AndroidX Security Crypto APIs) or secure storage mechanisms provided by the Android platform (e.g., `EncryptedSharedPreferences`, `KeyStore`). The absence of such mechanisms when sensitive data is identified is a strong indicator of a vulnerability.
4.  **Provide a JSON output:** Based on your analysis, provide a JSON output with two keys:
    * `"Vulnerable"`: Value should be `"Yes"`, `"No"`, or `"Needs manual review"`.
    * `"Description"`: A concise explanation of why you reached your conclusion, referencing the specific sensitive variable/key identified and the presence or absence of secure storage mechanisms.

**Code Snippet to Analyze:**
```java
//code snippet
````

**Expected JSON Output Format:**

```json
{
  "Vulnerable": "Yes" | "No" | "Needs manual review",
  "Description": "Reason for vulnerability assessment."
}
